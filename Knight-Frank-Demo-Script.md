### Opening (30 seconds)
so im going to give you a demo of one of our new products called Content Brain. and content brain generates written campaign content by repurposing large and comprehesive whitepapers into articles, linkedin posts and social captions. It essentially uses a whitepaper as a single source of truth for data and insights

so when you log into the interface youll be taken to the dashboard and to begin with you need to upload your whitepaper and you do this by navigating to the whitepaper tab here in the sidebar.

Youll then need to create a bucket, which is essentially a folder that holds all your whitepapers.

create a new bucket**

then youll need to upload your whitepaper by clicking the uploa whitepaper button and selecting the whitepaper you want to upload.

for the purpose of this demo well be using the knight frank 2025 wealth report.

once youve done that, in the back ground the whitepaper if being uploaded to a speacialdatabase called a vector database which is a special, high-deimensional database which allows generative ai models to pull and utilise relevant data accuratley and creativley.

this process normally takes about 30-90 secinds depending on the size of the whitepaper.

so ill cut back to when its done uploading!

**cut**

now that its done uploading we can utilise this white paper to generate our content. for this demo we're going to generate 1 months worth of content.

so were going to navigate to the generate content tab and at the top here you can see all of the HITL steps that we need to carry out and/or approve.

so initiallt we're going to select the whitepaper and now we have to fill in a small brief so that the agents in the background understand what we want it to do and provide it with the correct context.

all of the fields that need filling out are here so ill quickly cut th recording and fill those out.

**cut**

talk over inputs**

then were going to hit generate! 

now in the background between steps 2 and 3 are 2 agents.

the first agent is a brief writing agent, this agent takes out input and generates a comprehensive and AI-opitimsed marketing breif. this means that it takes our input and optimises it for ai to understand in a controlled manner. 

it then passes this brif to agent number 2 who is our he Creative Research Lead agent. - this agent takes teh brief and starts generating key themes that we could base our content on!

It starts by analysing and reading the whiteaper and asking thw whitepaper broad questions based on our inputs so marketing goals, target audience etc and then follows threads in the whitepaper that might seem intresting. from this it compiles all its evidence and genrates 3 potential themes that we can pick from at stage 3 wuth a HITL step. this step can take between 3 and 6 minutes so ill cut to it being done.

**vut**

now that the themes have been generated we can see the outputs 

go through out puts** 

if you dont like these themes you can re generate the content theme by clciking here.

this is the theme that each of our different forms of content will follow. so our article, linkedin posts and social captions will all follow the same theme.

once were happy we can select one and hit generate.

now whats happening in the backgorund is a system of 7 agents including evidence researches, initial drafters, copy editorial agents and they work together to create our peices fo content so that they are data-driven, accrate, creative and outputted in the correct format!

this step can take quite a while, around 5-10 miutes typically so ill cut to when theyre finsihed

**Agent 2 - The Creative Research Lead:** Now this one's fascinating. It's not just searching our whitepaper randomly - it's acting like our most curious researcher. It starts with broad questions based on our theme, then follows interesting threads. So it might start by searching for 'office market trends,' find something intriguing about hybrid working, then dive deeper into 'flexible space demand,' then follow that to 'tenant behavior changes.' It's conducting 10-12 of these iterative searches, building up a comprehensive understanding just like a human researcher would, but in seconds instead of hours.

**Agent 3 - The Evidence Detective:** Once we choose our angle, this agent becomes our fact-checker and evidence gatherer. It goes back through all our research with laser focus, extracting every statistic, case study, and data point that supports our chosen narrative. If we're talking about the rise of flexible office space, it'll find every relevant metric, every trend indicator, every piece of supporting evidence in our research.

**Agents 4A, 4B, and 4C - The Specialist Writers:** These are our content creation specialists. Agent 4A writes like The Economist - sophisticated, analytical, but accessible to intelligent business readers. Agent 4B understands LinkedIn's professional audience and knows how to craft thought leadership that generates engagement. Agent 4C gets social media - it knows how to distill complex insights into shareable, impactful posts that still maintain our credibility.

**Agents 5A, 5B, and 5C - The Editorial Team:** Our quality control specialists. They review everything for consistency, clarity, and brand voice. They're making sure the tone is right, the facts are accurate, and each piece of content achieves its specific platform objectives."

#### Step 4: The Results
*[Select a theme and show generated content]*

**"And there we have it. In the time it took me to explain the process, we now have a complete content campaign. Two detailed market analysis articles that could run in Property Week, four LinkedIn posts that position our team as thought leaders, and eight social media posts that'll drive engagement across our channels. All of it based on our actual research, all of it consistent with our brand voice, all of it optimized for our specific audience."**

### 3. Content Management & The Business Impact (1 minute)
**Navigate to: http://localhost:3000/history**

**"Every campaign gets saved here, and this is where you can really see the business impact. Each campaign shows you exactly which research drove which content, so when new data comes in, we can quickly update our messaging across all channels."**

**"Let me put this in real terms. Sarah's team typically spends about a month turning a research report into a full content campaign. We just did the same thing in 10 minutes. That's not just efficiency - that's competitive advantage. When we publish new research on, say, the impact of flexible working on office demand, we can have thought leadership content live across all our channels while our competitors are still reading the executive summary."**

**"But here's what really excites me - every single piece of content is backed by our research and expertise. We're not creating generic AI content. We're amplifying Knight Frank's intellectual property and getting it in front of our audience faster and more consistently than ever before."**

### Closing (30 seconds)
**"Look, this isn't about replacing our brilliant research and marketing teams. It's about giving them superpowers. Our researchers can focus on deeper insights knowing their work will reach maximum impact. Our marketing team can focus on strategy and relationship building rather than spending weeks on content creation."**

**"The way I see it, we have two choices: we can lead the market with this technology, or we can watch our competitors use it to reach our audience first with insights our own research teams discovered. Which would you prefer?"**
